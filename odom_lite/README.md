###**Project Synopsis**

Our robot's gyroscope is broken, hence we are unable to get odometry readings a conventional way.  This node estimates teh odometry based on linear and angular velocity of the robot.  This is, of course, subject to drift, but since we have analized our robot's behavior at various speeds, this is fairly accurate **for our robot**.  The parameters would be subject to change of a different robot was used.
